# Flora Park Mystery

Created for the 2023 Global Game Jam. You are Detective Moss. Private eye with a special ability: you can talk to plants! Unfortunately, plants aren't very familiar with human concepts like "crime" and "murder". So when your dear friend and gardener at the nearby park has suddenly disappeared, it's up to you to piece together eyewitness accounts from the various flora in Flora Park, and solve the case.
